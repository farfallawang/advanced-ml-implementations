Implement four advanced machine learning algorithms from scratch in python, including the following:

1. GAN (Tested on MNIST)

2. Denoising auto-encoder (dAE) 

3. Variational auto-encoder (VAE)

4. Generated Adversarial Examples to Fool ResNet

*Note: First three models have been tested on MNIST dataset*
